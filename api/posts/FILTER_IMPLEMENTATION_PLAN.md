# Posts Filter Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for the four main filter types in the posts API:

1. **Discover**
2. **Following**
3. **What's Hot**
4. **Popular in my Groups**

## Current Status

- âœ… **What's Hot**: Implemented with engagement scoring
- âœ… **Discover**: Implemented with user associations integration
- âœ… **Following**: Implemented with user associations integration
- âœ… **Popular in my Groups**: Implemented with user associations integration
- âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: User Associations Integration

## Filter Type Details

### 1. Discover

**Purpose**: Show posts from users the current user doesn't follow to help discover new content.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete

- Queries user associations table to get list of users the current user follows
- Filters posts to exclude posts from followed users
- Sorts by engagement score
- Handles cases where user is not authenticated (falls back to latest posts)

**Database Queries**:

```typescript
// Get user's following list
const following = await getUserFollowing(userId);

// Get posts excluding followed users
const posts = await getPostsExcludingUsers(following, offset, pageSize);
```

### 2. Following

**Purpose**: Show posts only from users the current user follows.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete

- Queries user associations table to get list of users the current user follows
- Filters posts to only include posts from followed users
- Sorts by timestamp (newest first)
- Handles empty following lists gracefully

**Database Queries**:

```typescript
// Get user's following list
const following = await getUserFollowing(userId);

// Get posts from followed users only
const posts = await getPostsFromUsers(following, offset, pageSize);
```

### 3. What's Hot

**Purpose**: Show the most engaging content across the platform.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete

- Calculates engagement score based on views, reactions, comments, and favorites
- Sorts by engagement score
- Weights: views (0.1), reactions (2), comments (3), favorites (2)

### 4. Popular in my Groups

**Purpose**: Show posts from groups the user is a member of, sorted by engagement within those groups.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete

- Queries user associations table to get list of groups the user is a member of
- Filters posts to only include posts from those groups
- Sorts by engagement score within the groups
- Handles empty group memberships gracefully

**Database Queries**:

```typescript
// Get user's group memberships
const groups = await getUserGroups(userId);

// Get posts from user's groups
const posts = await getPostsFromGroups(groups, offset, pageSize);
```

## Phase 1: User Associations Integration âœ… COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks:

1. âœ… Implemented `getUserFollowing()` function
2. âœ… Implemented `getUserGroups()` function
3. âœ… Updated filter logic to use these functions
4. âœ… Added proper error handling
5. âœ… Updated IAM permissions for user associations table access
6. âœ… Implemented user associations API endpoints (GET and PUT)

### User Associations API Endpoints:

- `GET /user/associations` - Get user's following list and group memberships
- `POST /user/associations` - Create following relationship or group membership

### Database Schema:

```typescript
interface UserAssociation {
  PK: string; // "USER#${userId}"
  SK: string; // "FOLLOWING#${followedUserId}" or "GROUP#${groupId}"
  association_type: string; // "following" or "group_member"
  created_at: string;
  role?: string; // "member", "admin", "moderator"
  joined_at?: string;
  target_user_id?: string;
  group_id?: string;
}
```

## Phase 2: Database Optimization ðŸ”„ NEXT

### Planned Tasks:

1. ðŸ”„ Add GSIs for efficient filtering
2. ðŸ”„ Implement engagement score pre-calculation
3. ðŸ”„ Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
4. ðŸ”„ Optimize queries for large following lists

### GSI Recommendations:

```typescript
// GSI for user_id + timestamp (for following filter)
{
  name: "UserTimestampIndex",
  hashKey: "user_id",
  rangeKey: "timestamp",
  projectionType: "ALL"
}

// GSI for group_id + engagement_score (for groups filter)
{
  name: "GroupEngagementIndex",
  hashKey: "group_id",
  rangeKey: "engagement_score",
  projectionType: "ALL"
}

// GSI for engagement_score + timestamp (for what's hot)
{
  name: "EngagementTimestampIndex",
  hashKey: "engagement_score",
  rangeKey: "timestamp",
  projectionType: "ALL"
}
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

### Planned Tasks:

1. ðŸ“‹ Implement time decay for engagement scores
2. ðŸ“‹ Add group-specific engagement metrics
3. ðŸ“‹ Implement search functionality
4. ðŸ“‹ Add personalized recommendations
5. ðŸ“‹ Add analytics and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed:

- Test each filter type with mock data
- Test pagination logic
- Test engagement score calculation
- Test error handling
- Test user associations integration

### Integration Tests Needed:

- Test with real DynamoDB data
- Test user associations integration
- Test performance with large datasets

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation:

- Uses `ScanCommand` with client-side filtering and sorting
- Suitable for small to medium datasets
- Direct DynamoDB queries for user associations

### Optimization Opportunities:

- Use GSIs to replace scans with queries
- Pre-calculate engagement scores
- Implement caching for user associations
- Use batch operations for large following lists
- Add time-based filtering to avoid old posts

## Security Considerations

### Access Control:

- âœ… Users can only see posts they have permission to view
- âœ… User associations are private to each user
- âœ… Proper authentication and authorization

### Data Privacy:

- âœ… Following lists are private
- âœ… Group memberships are validated
- âœ… No exposure of sensitive user data

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Phase 1**: Deploy the current implementation to test with real data
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes
3. **Phase 2 Planning**: Design and implement GSIs based on usage patterns
4. **Monitoring**: Add CloudWatch metrics for filter usage and performance

## API Endpoints Needed

### User Associations API

- `GET /user/associations` - Get user's following list and group memberships
- `POST /user/associations` - Create following relationship or group membership

### Groups API (if not exists)

- `GET /groups` - List groups
- `GET /groups/{groupId}` - Get group details
- `POST /groups` - Create group
- `PUT /groups/{groupId}` - Update group

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics to Track

- Filter usage distribution
- Response times for each filter type
- Cache hit rates
- User engagement with different filter types

### Alerts

- High response times
- Cache miss rates
- Database query performance
- Error rates
